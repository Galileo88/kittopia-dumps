### KittopiaTech Dumps
In this repository you can view the stock planetary system of Kerbal Space Program, 
exported into Kopernicus-style configs. The data in this repository is intended to be used
as a reference when editing the stock planets or creating new planets, the configs **will not actually
work in-game!** As soon as you copy them into your GameData folder, you are on your own.
